Here's the study guide:

Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning algorithms

Dependent vs. Independent Variables

Training vs. Testing data: train-validation-test split

Linear regression: residuals, linearization

Regression Analysis: parametric and non-parametric models, R-Squared and MSE

Logistic Regression: intercept, slope, cross-entropy

K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm: hyperparameters

Decision Trees (self-study): Leaf nodes and predictions

In all of the above, explain the algorithm
